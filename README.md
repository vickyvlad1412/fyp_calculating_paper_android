# Numora

## Description
Numora is a calculating paper app that blends a calculator with note taking features. Just like doing calculations on a paper, Numora allows users to work with calculation and take notes without changing their workspace. Numora supports infinite decimal precision and allows users to work with as many significant figures as they want to. Numora can compute calculations involving exponents, logarithmic functions, factorials and trigonometric functions. On top of that, Numora also offers users to use variables in their calculations. Other than calculations, Numora also has graphing features. In their note, users can plot graphs along their calculations to aid in their math work.

## Features & How To Use Them
All features and how to use them will be provided in the video demo below.

### Creating A Note
Press the floating action button on the bottom right to create a new note. Once a new note is created, it can be saved by pressing the save icon on the top right.

### Editing A Note
Created notes are displayed on the homepage as a list of tiles. Tap on a note to edit it.

### Deleting A Note
On the homepage, tap on the three dots on the note that you want to delete. A pop up option will show, tap on Delete and confirm your decision to delete the note.

### Archiving A Note
On the homepage, tap on the three dots on the note that you want to archive. A pop up option will show, tap on Archive to archive the note.

### Viewing An Archived Note
Open the App Drawer by tapping on the three lines on the top left in the homepage. Tap on Archive to view all archived notes. Tap on a note to view a particular archived note.

### Changing App Theme
Open the App Drawer by tapping on the three lines on the top left in the homepage. Tap on Settings to open the settings page. Toggle the button under Dark Mode to switch between light and dark mode.

### Doing Calculations
Open a note to do calculations in it. Use the toggle keyboard button on the bottom center of the page to toggle between the custom keyboard and default system keyboard. Type in an expression you want to calculate and press the "Evaluate" button.

### Changing Decimal Precision
When doing calculation in a note, tap on the tune icon on the top right of the page. Enter the desired decimal precision you want and press Save to change the decimal precision. Alternatively, you can navigate to the settings page through the App Drawer and change the decimal precision on the settings page.

### Using Variables
Open a note to do calculations in it. Use the toggle keyboard button on the bottom center of the page to toggle between the custom keyboard and default system keyboard. Type and assign a value to a variable such as "x = 5" and press the "Evaluate" button to save the variable. Go to the next line and perform operations (e.g. x+3) or apply functions (e.g. sin(x)) to the variable and press the "Evaluate" button. Up to 3 variables can be saved and used in a single note.

### Plotting Graphs
Open a note to plot graph in it. Press the button with the graph icon on it on the bottom right of the page. A graph block will be generated. Enter an equation in the text field (e.g. y = 3*x) and press the Plot button to plot the graph. Equations need to be in the form of a y function with respect to x in order to plot the graph. (e.g. y = 3*cos(x)+5)

### Searching For A Note
Tap on the search icon on the top right in the homepage. A search page will be opened. Type in phrases or equations you want to search, and choose the note you were searching for from the search results.

## How To Install
Clone this git repo into your local repo. Open the project in your desired IDE (Android Studio is recommended). Run "pub upgrade" and "pub get" in the terminal to install the dependencies. Choose a device or emulator you want to install the application in. Open the terminal and type in the command "flutter build apk --release --no-tree-shake-icons" and press Enter.
