## Description

Just like doing calculations on a paper, Numora allows users to work with calculation and take notes without changing their workspace. Numora supports infinite decimal precision and allows users to work with as many significant figures as they want to. Numora can compute calculations involving exponents, logarithm, factorials and trigonometry. On top of that, Numora also offers users to use variables in their calculations.
